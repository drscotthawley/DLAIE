    "# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Basic Idea \n",
    "\n",
    "A [Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) consists of an \"arms race\" between a pair of sub-networks that compete against one another. One network, called the Generator, acts like a art forger, trying to create data examples (often images) that will full the other network, called the Discriminator or Critic, into classifying them as \"real\" images from a supplied dataset.  The following illustration by [Dev Nang](https://medium.com/@devnag/generative-adversarial-networks-gans-in-50-lines-of-code-pytorch-e81b79659e3f) depicts a GAN, in which the Discriminator acts like a \"detective\" trying to \"catch\" the forger: \n",
    "\n",
    "![dev nang gan example](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*-gFsbymY9oJUQJ-A3GTfeg.png?h)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Generator usually takes as its input a vector of random noise, but it can also be \"conditioned\" on various control parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Discriminator is binary classifier, which outputs a number between 0 (for images regarded to be fake) and 1 (for images regarded to be real).\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the network learns is that the Discriminator and the Generator \"share notes\", i.e. the Discriminator shares the value of its loss function, which the Generator then uses to perform gradient *ascent* (not descent) to try to tweak its (the Generator's) weights so that *next time* the Discriminator will be more likely to classify the fake image as being real. \n",
    "\n",
    "## (Were) Tricky In Practice\n",
    "If one naively implements the \"basic idea\", typically what you'll get is that the Generator will get \"stuck\" spitting out essentially the same, low-quality images over & over. This is known as \"mode collapse\", and intuitively (if you'll forgive the continued anthropomorphism), it's as if the Generator doesn't know what to do anymore to improve the images, and the Discriminator has gotten *so good* that the Generator just never even has a chance to improve incrementally, so it just \"goes with what it knows best\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus GANs developed a reputation of being sort of \"a simple and powerful idea, but hard to successfully implement,\" until some improvements came along.  For this week's Assignment (later), you'll get to code up a successful GAN example that instead of using the Binary Cross-Entropy Loss that we used before, we'll use a different loss function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get thta specific though, let's take a look at some examples. "
