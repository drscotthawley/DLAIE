        "Backpropagation is the (most popular) method by which artificial neural networks learn: it is how gradient descent is implemented in multi-layer networks. In the simplest of terms, backpropagation is just the Chain Rule from differential calculus.  But saying \"it's just the Chain Rule,\" while conceptually true, can hide some of the intricacy involved in actually coding it up.  In this lesson we walk through implementations of backpropgation from scratch as well as with two major neural network libraries. "

This image is a bit more complicated than diagrams one might typically encounter; I wanted to be able to show and label all the different \"parts.\"  We will explain what the various symbols mean as we continue after the figure.\n",
