So we may wish to regard related words such as \"jump\", \"jumping\", \"jumps\",... as variations on the *stem* of \"jump\".  We may hang on to the endings such as \"-ing\" for later use, regarding them as additional tokens. The process of *stemming* or \"*stemmification*\" is the breaking up of words into their stems and hanging on to endings (or not).  Also, what about compound words?  Some languages such as German will make very long single words (e.g. Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung for \"speed limit\") that in other languages would be considered as separate words. If language translation is our goal, some way of tokenizing that includes such variability would be important.  Also, what about punctuation? To keep things simple, we could just delete all forms of punctuation -- or expand contractions like \"I'll\" to \"I will\", and so forth -- and yet if we want a highly accurate model we may find that holding on to some forms of punctuation will important.\n",

Expressing these frequencies as fractions of the total number of words, we could then assign to each word its pair of \"positive use\" and \"negative use\" frequency values $(f_p, f_n)$ which lie in the two-dimensional [unit square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_square) (shown below). These would then form the coordinates for a *word vector* of our word in its *embedding* space (i.e., the unit square in this case).

From there it proceeds into a look at a family system, in which everyone plays by a set of unexamined rules, and uses the mother\\'s cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. <br /><br />William Hurt as the self-important father, and Meryl Streep as the Suzy Homemaker mother are both superb; nuanced and not what they appear to be. Zeleweger is seething, angry and surprised with herself. Tom Everett Scott doesn\\'t have much to do, but he does it well.<br /><br />The story is predictable, and takes at least one badly soppy turn it needn\\'t have taken, but the performances, and the view of family as a place where anger and love are equally mixed, make it worthwhile.'"

Neural networks don't exactly work with look-up tables but they can work with a very close analogue via matrix multiplication: What we do is take the word codes (/indexes) an use these to denote the rows (or columns) of a *one-hot encoding*, which is a matrix with zeros almost everywhere, and a 1 in each column & row.  The simplest version being just a diagonal matrix of 1's which can be created by functions like Numpy's `eye`.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Note: Literally, the code you'd write is simply `np.eye(len(tokens))`. It's so simple that we're not even going to make a programming assignment for it, but we *will* do a slighly trickier exercise below.\n",
        "\n",
        "Say for example we only had 3 words in our vocabulary, \"James\", \"loves\", and \"tacos\".  The one-hot encoding for these could be\n",

        "```\n",
        "'James' = [1, 0, 0]\n",
        "'loves' = [0, 1, 0]\n",
        "'tacos' = [0, 0, 1]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Then a look-up table could be created when we multiply the *matrix* of one-hot encoded words (i.e.  `np.eye(3)` in this case) with whatever number we want.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"number we want\" will be a set of numbers, in the form of *weights* of a neural network `Linear` layer (with no activation, i.e. linear activation).  This will produce our word embeddings!  To be clear: the weights will be the same as the activations because we are multiplying \"1\" by the weights and using no activation.  The dimension of the word vectors produced will be determined by how many dimensions we want in this Linear layer of weights -- for example, we mentioned 300 before.\n",
        "\n",
        "These weights (i.e. the word embeddings themselves) are initialized randomly and *learned* in the context of training the model for whatever task we want.\n",
        "\n",
        "You might wonder: is using just one Linear layer with no activation sufficient to accurately map out human language to the point fo being able to produce meaningful embeddings?  In practice, this is remarkably effective, and in fact the `nn.Embedding` layers in both PyTorch and Jupyter are literally just one-hot encoders attached to Linear layers (in Keras they're called \"Dense\" layers).  \n",
        "\n",
        "How useful will these embeddings be?  Well, that's an interesting question. \"Universal\" word embedding such as Word2Vec of GloVe are trained on huge datasets in order to be as general as possible, whereas if you were to simply train on a very small dataset, your embeddings might be only useful for the specific task you want.  Generally, it's useful to start with pretrained embeddings in a \"frozen\" (non-trainable) state as you train the downstream part of your neural network, and then gradually \"unfreeze\" the network starting fro the later layers and working backward was the model trains.  (The ULMFiT method referenced earlier describes a detailed way of doing this.)"

The cost of training these models is felt both economically and *environmentally*: burning all that energy [incurs a significant carbon footprint](https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/04/gpt3_carbon_footprint_estimate/).  Thus, we can see that in practical cases where we want sophisticated, accurate results that require large models and large datasets (rather than simple examples for teaching purposes),  Transfer Learning (i.e. starting from a pre-trained model and then fine-tuning on a smaller domain-specific dataset) rather than training from scratch becomes *not only the expedient choice but also the ethically sounder choice*.\n",

So when it comes time to do the text classification, we will switch over (to Chapter 10 content) and load the fastai checkpoints that were already trained on Wikitext.  Think of it like a \"cooking show\" on TV, where they come back from commercial and everything's already cooked!\n"

        "\n",
        "The leftmost sigmoid is called the \"forget gate\".  The variable $c$ functions as the \"memory\" of the cell.  Based on the input $x$ and the previous hidden state $h$, the weights feeding into the forget gate determine whether to \"forget\" $c$ by multiplying it by zero, or to \"remember\" it (i.e. allow it to pass through) by multiplying it by 1, or -- and this is important -- *some number between 0 and 1* -- thus the remembering isn't an all-or-nothing proposition, but instead is *continuous* and therefore *differentiable* and therefore *amenable to training by gradient descent!*\n",

        "The next sigmoid is called the \"input gate\", which works in concert with the orange tanh gate (known as the \"cell gate\") which performs an operation somewhat analagous to the older RNN's tanh activation, except this is *only for modifying the cell's memory $c$.  The input gate decides how much of the new input to \"remember\".\n",

        "### Regularization Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "Another thing we can do to improve the model's performance on the validation set goes under the topic of \"regularization\".  Regularization, conceptually, is any means we might try to \"make life harder\" for the training part of the code, so that it can generalize better.  Data augmentation -- such as rotating images, changing their intensity or contrast, or removing groups of pixels from the image -- is one example of regularization that we've already seen.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Dropout\n",
        "\n",
        "Akin to removing pixels from an image in the training set (never in the validation set BTW), is to *randomly turn off neurons in the network during training*.  This is called [Dropout](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/2627435.2670313) and is a powerful method that is standard practice in Deep Learning. Dropout works by randomly turning off neurons during training, but keeping them all one when doing predictions (e.g. on the validation set).  In so doing, you make the network \"work harder\" to develop more powerful, more general, internal representations and to filter out \"noisy\" details you might not want the model to focus on. Dropout appears as a standard network layer in most DL libraries, and includes a parameter whereby you can tell it what fraction of cells in the layer to turn off during each iteration.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Weight Decay\n",
        "\n",
        "There's another important method called Weight Decay that gets discussed earlier in the fastai book.  Weight Decay is where you *make the magnitude of the weigths part of the loss function* -- you just add up the squares of the weights (so called \"L2 regularization\" because adding up squared things is part of an \"L2 norm\") and add that into the loss function.  The result is that the model will learn to keep the weights from getting too big, which could otherwise lead to overfitting -- again, the idea is to make things *hard* for the model while training. Schemically it looks like:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "loss = loss + weights.pow(2).mean()*wd\n",
        "```\n",
        "where `wd` is the \"strength\" of the weight decay regularization: More means that the weights will make up a bigger part of the loss, which we're trying to *minimize* via gradient descent, so a larger `wd` parameter will lead to more minimizing of the model weights. This has the effect of reducing overfitting and (usually) improving generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Activation Regularization\n",
        "Related to weight decay is the act of making sure the neuron activations themselves don't get too large: we just add the L2 norm of the activations to the loss function as well.  To implement this we'll need to output not just the hidden state of the LSTM cell but the activations (so we can put them in the loss function).  fastai is going to handle all this for us by using the `RNNRegularizer()` callback.\n",
