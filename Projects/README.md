# Projects

You will do a project in this course. It can be on a topic you're interested in, anything related to Deep Learning & AI Ethics.  This could take a form that includes:

* Training and deploying an app that performs predictive analytics or generative data in a domain of your interest

* Probing an existing pretrained model for societal biases

* Competing in a Kaggle competition

* Providing an explanation of the methods & ideas used in a research paper, and a brief demo

* Developing a dataset

* Running a comparison of different models on the same dataset

  



## "Deliverables:"

* **Proposal**: Your first required work on this project will be a one-page proposal for your project, describing the concept of your project, its purpose (why you are doing it), a list of equipment/software/data you will obtain and use for the project, and a timeline consisting of various "milestones" to meet along the way and with which to track your progress.  **Due Friday Oct 13 by noon,**  uploaded as PDF to Canvas.
* **Presentation:** Scheduled for our final exam time period.  Since we have 2 hours and 12 students, that will mean 10 minutes per person -- note that 10 minutes goes by very quickly!  You will be asked to *prerecord* your presentation so that this can go smoothly. 



## Guidelines

* This will be a (half) semester project, so it's good to keep in mind that "time flies" and not to be too ambitious.  Yet tools like fastai allow us to leverage and integrate many sophisticated methods quickly in a (somewhat) user-friendly way!
* This is not a weekend project, i.e. the amount of research & presentation work should constitute more than what one might simply accomplish in an afternoon.
* Ethics: Akin to the NeurIPS conference, some statement on the ethical considerations and implications inherent in your work will be required.
